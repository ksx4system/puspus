# Welcome to Puspus #

Puspus is an automated set of processes to build a Debian system for an IBM Netvista 8363. Puspus is based on a linux kernel version 2.6.22. On build completion, puspus delivers an image file which is copied on a compact flash memory and is ready to boot off an IBM Netvista thin client computer.

The system becomes an ideal expandable Debian solution both as a desktop based computer as well as a compact in-house server for development, testing, storage, and other automation tasks.

Puspus is released under the GPLv2 license, you are encouraged to download and use it for free. You can contact me at skarbat@gmai.com for requests for updates, changes and collaborations.

Enjoy!
